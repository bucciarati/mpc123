For version 1.0:
- command line option to loop playlist (repeat functionality)
- show playback times at runtime (maybe only in -v output)
- make it usable by frontends
  - add all commands like forward, backward, pause, ..
  - conform to other similar programs, but only if there is a widely-used way

Hypotesis:
- add support for id3 tags ? (do mpc files support it?)
