For version 1.0:
- command line option to loop playlist (repeat functionality)
- make it usable by frontends
  - add all commands like forward, backward, pause, ..
  - conform to other similar programs, but only if there is a widely-used way
- make a decent localization system, and localize in few languages

Hypotesis:
- maybe create a logo ?
- add support for id3 tags ? (do mpc files support it?)
