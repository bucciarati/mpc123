.SH NAME
mpc123 \- your handy Musepack audio player
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mpc123 [options] file(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
mpc123 is a command\-line player for the Musepack audio compression
format. mpc123 reads mpc audio files and decodes them to the devices
specified on the command line.

During playback, you can pass to the next playlist element (or a random one
if one of the \-z and \-Z options were used, see below) by sending SIGINT
to the process, thus usually pressing ^C will act as a "next-button" for the
player.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-\-gain N\fP, \fB\-g N\fP" 4
Set gain (audio volume) to \fBN\fP (0\-100 inclusive, default 100,
0 mutes sound)

.IP "\fB\-\-audiodevice dev\fP, \fB\-a dev\fP" 4
Use \fBdev\fP for audio\-out; If not specified, the program tries to pick
some sane defaults, based on the used audio output driver. Common devices
include:
.IP "  \fB/dev/dsp\fP or \fB/dev/dsp1\fP" 4

.IP "  \fBdefault\fP or \fBhw:0\fP" 4

Use au file \fBfilename.au\fP for output

.IP "\fB\-\-cdr filename.cdr\fP, \fB\-c filename.cdr\fP"
Use raw file \fBfilename.cdr\fP for output (this can be used directly
with cdrecord's \-audio option)

.IP "\fB\-\-wav filename.wav\fP, \fB\-w filename.wav\fP"
Use wave file \fBfilename.wav\fP for output

.IP "\fB\-\-list file\fP, \fB\-@ file\fP"
Use playlist \fBfile\fP as list of Musepack files; The playlist format is
simple: one file per line.
You can easily generate a playlist for \fBmpc123\fP with the find(1)
command:
.IP "    find /path/to/musicroot \-iname \\\\*.mpc \-fprint \fBfile\fP" 4

Play files randomly until interrupted

.IP "\fB\-\-shuffle\fP, \fB\-z\fP"

verbose mpc123 becomes

.IP "\fB\-\-quiet\fP, \fB\-q\fP"
Reset verbosity to 0 (no title or boilerplate); this is the default

.IP "\fB\-\-help\fP, \fB\-h\fP"
